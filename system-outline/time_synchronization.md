## Time Synchronization in the Hydra

We need to synchronize time across SBCs so we are able to match data points with each other (i.e. wave breaks at the same time as another event). 

One solution is to use the GPS time data to sync up the supervisor's time. Must explore how we can sync the Latte Pandas (camera SBCs) as well.
