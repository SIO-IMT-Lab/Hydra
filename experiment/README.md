# Experiment

This directory contains small prototype scripts used to test multiprocessing and communication patterns. They are not part of the main Hydra modules but serve as references for future development.

- `producer_consumer/` — experiments with Python threads and queues
- `pubsub_zmq/` — minimal examples using ZeroMQ for publish/subscribe messaging
