# Sensor Modules

All code for interacting with the Hydra sensors lives here. Each subdirectory corresponds to a category of devices or supporting documentation.

- `cameras/` — camera driver implementations
- `c-sensors/` — "c" sensor modules (GPS, MET1, SITA, etc.)
- `compositions/` — higher level modules that combine sensors together
- `sensor-docs/` — notes and guides for operating sensors
- `tests/` — test suites for the sensor code
