# C Sensors

Modules for sensors other than the cameras. Each subfolder contains the code for a specific device.

- `gps/` – GPS receiver interface
- `met1/` – air particle counter (MET1)
- `sita/` – SITA serial device

The `sensor.py` file defines common base functionality shared across these modules.
