## Storing sensor data on Raspi (non cams)

- Store only essential information (time, measurement, ?)
- Compress files (lossless) after a certain size. When that gets full weâ€™ll move the glider state into LOW POWER and conclude the mission.
- Project how long it takes to fill up Raspi storage

Tasks:

- [ ] Napkin mask to see how much Raspi can hold
- [ ] Explore lossless compression techniques
