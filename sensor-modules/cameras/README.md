# Cameras

Drivers and utilities for Hydra's camera systems.

Currently two FLIR based cameras are supported:

* **BubbleCam** – the original camera module.
* **FoamCam** – a second camera sharing the same implementation but with its
  own configuration.

Shared functionality lives in ``sensor-modules/cameras/common``.
