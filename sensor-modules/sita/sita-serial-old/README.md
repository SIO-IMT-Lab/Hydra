Old sita code, with some other exploratory code that was originally on the supervisor sbc.

Sita example code lies in GetSerial.py and SitaSerialTest.py with example outputs from these programs in the .txt files.

Other code explored pub/sub comms, 1pps signal interrupts/handler, and remote power toggling. Feel free to ignore these
files,
but they're included in order to accurately capture this aspect of the old supervisor's codebase.
